## Notes

- React is a JavaScript library to enhance the UI of an app - in an MVC model (Model, View, Controller), it handles the View components.
- Widely used in the industry as it is extremely fast and responsive and very fast in rendering UI in the browser, therefore can be scaled up to launch complex UI features. 
- It has the ability to have nested components. 
- It is easily pluggable into exisiting applications.
- Within a return statement, tags should be wrapped in a single element e.g. in a ```<div></div>```. 
- One of the most powerful features of React is it's ability to reuse components.
- Props look similar to attributes within a a HTML tag e.g.  in ```<Product name="Android" price="121"/>```, 'name' and 'price' are the props. 
- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It was written to be used with React. JSX code looks a lot like HTML.
- If a JavaScript file contains JSX code, then that file will have to be compiled. That means that before the file reaches a web browser, a JSX compiler will translate any JSX into regular JavaScript.
- JSX elements can also be nested inside other JSX elemnents e.g. ```<a href="https://www.example.com"> <h1>Click me!</h1> </a>```.
